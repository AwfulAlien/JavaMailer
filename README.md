Simple Java + Springboot application which sends e-mails to provided mail IDs from my temp account (baahubali.dev1@gmail.com). password will be empty in the application.properties file. if u urself going to refer this in future or someone else please go to google account settings and enable 2FA and in that screen itself generate something called "App Passwords" and put it in the password field which is in the application.properties file.. Cheers..!
